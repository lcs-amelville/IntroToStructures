# Authoring Structures
 
 Refer to this [list of formulas for various geometric figures](https://www.eqao.com/en/assessments/grade-9-math/assessment-docs/g9-formula-sheet-academic.pdf) (from the Grade 9 EQAO Mathematics assessment).
 
 Select two 2D shapes, and author a structure that:
 
 * describes the shape
 * reports on the area
 * reports on the perimeter

 Select two 3D shapes, and author a structure that:

 * describes the shape
 * reports on the surface area
 * reports on the volue

 Finally:

 * at least three of your formulas must involve a power
 * at least two of your formulas must involve a fraction
 * at least three of your formulas must use ùùø
 
 Be sure to:

 * make good choices for structure names and property names
 * test your structures by creating instances, and trying the properties out to be sure they provide correct results
 
 Remember to *commit* and *push* your work regularly ‚Äì¬†at a minimum after defining each structure.
